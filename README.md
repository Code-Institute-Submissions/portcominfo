## UX 





## Goals
### External user's goal:

The site users are residents and potential residents of Portarlington in County Laois, Ireland who want to learn more about the history and amenities of the town. 

### Site owner's goals:
The site owner wants to help the local community by highlighting events that are happening in the local area and also to sell merchandise that the site owner has produced. 

### Potential features: 
* Showcase photos both historical and modern of the town

## Features 

## Pages
### Home
Information about the page and the Portarlington Community Information Project.

### Local information
This page will have a list of local facilities about:
* Banking
* Church
* Food
* Fuel
* Leisure
* Pharmacy

Above the navigation for these categories will be a box with a button looking for intereaction with the user.  

Some categories will have a recommended entry marked with a red heart using an icon from Fontawesome. 

### Support us
This page will have opportunities to support the local community organisation by highlighting merchandise available from local shops or online.

## Design

### Imagery 

### Colour Scheme
The main colour is a <span style="color:#872658">Dark Rasberry #872658</span>, which is an approximation for the colour of the Portarlington GAA and Rugby clubs colours. This colour is used for the footer background, and for most headings.

I used Adobe Colour to find complementary colours which are used to highlight each of the sections in the Information page. 

### Typography
The two typefaces used complement each other and clearly distinguish between items. 

#### Headings
Use the [Fieldwork](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/fieldwork) font. 

#### Body text and menus 
The [Le Monde Livre Classic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/le-monde-livre-classic) typeface is used for body text and menus. When choosing the font, particular care was taken to ensure that ≪Old Style≫ numbers were available. 



### Continuity 
The page is designed to be user-friendly. The same templates are used on each page with similar headers and footers. This should make it easy and accessible for each user.

### Frameworks Used

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used via the [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) platform to create, commit, and push changes in the code to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - Project stored in a repository and to incorporate changes made using Git. Also used for deployment via GitHub Pages.

## Testing 
* All HTML code was validated by [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* All CSS stylings were validated by [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Images 

Following feedback from my mentor that the images on the site were far too large to download quickly, especially if users were on a mobile connection, I used the [tinypng.com](https://www.tinypng.com) to reduce their sizes. The three clothing pictures on the Support page were reduced in size by about 80%. 

* Different browsers... 

## Deployment 
PortInfo-2021 was deployed using GitHub Pages. The following steps were followed: 

1. Log into GitHub and locate the [PortInfo-2021 repository](https://github.com/michaelmcfarlandcampbell/portcominfo).
2.  Press the <span style="background-color:#198754;color:white;padding:5px">Settings</span> button at the top of the page. 
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you get to the **Git Hub Pages** section. 
4. Under **Source** click where it says "None" and select "Branch: master".
5. The page will refresh automatically. 
6. Scroll back down to find **GitHub Pages** section, and the link to the site will be displayed.
