## Design
### Imagery 

### Colour Scheme

### Typography
The two fonts are used to complement each other and clearly distinguish between items. 
#### Headings
Use the Fieldwork font. 

#### Body text and menus 
The [Le Monde Livre Classic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/le-monde-livre-classic) typeface is used for body text and menus. When choosing the font, particular care was taken to ensure that ≪Old Style≫ numbers were available. 



### Continuity 
The page is designed to be user-friendly. The same templates are used on each page with similar headers and footers. This should make it easy and accessible for each user.
