### Structure 
The structure of the site is as a tree 
<img src="readme/portinfo-2021-sitemap.png" alt="Site Map">

### Skeleton
When creating the website, I used responsive design. When the site is expanded from a mobile, stacked elements will display in two columns in each row, this means that more of the website can be seen at once. 
#### Mobile

### Potential features: 
* Showcase photos both historical and modern of the town
* Showcase local shops
* Shop to purchase merchandise  

## Pages
### Home
Information about the page and the Portarlington Community Information Project.

### Local information
This page will have a list of local facilities about:
* Banking
* Church
* Food
* Fuel
* Leisure
* Pharmacy

Above the navigation for these categories will be a box with a button looking for intereaction with the user.  

Some categories will have a recommended entry marked with a red heart using an icon from Fontawesome. 

### Support us
This page will have opportunities to support the local community organisation by highlighting merchandise available from local shops or online.

## Design

### Imagery 
As Portarlington straddles the border between the counties of Laois and of Offaly, which is mainly along the River Barrow at this point, I used a photograph of one of the old bridges in the town that crosses the river. 

As part of the navigation on the [Local Information](https://michaelmcfarlandcampbell.github.io/portcominfo/information.html) page, I used well-known icons from the Fontawesome library. Of particular note is the Rx symbol for Prescription for the Pharmacy. These icons are then also used above the heading in each section of that page to ensure continuity. 

### Colour Scheme
The main colour is 
* ![872658](https://via.placeholder.com/15/872658/000000?text=+) `#872658` which is an approximation for the colour of the Portarlington GAA and Rugby clubs colours. This colour is used for the footer background, and for most headings.

I used Adobe Colour to find complementary colours which are used to highlight each of the sections in the Information page. 

### Typography

#### Headings
Use the [Fieldwork](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/fieldwork) font. 

#### Body text and menus 
The [Le Monde Livre Classic](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/le-monde-livre-classic) typeface is used for body text and menus. When choosing the font, particular care was taken to ensure that ≪Old Style≫ numbers were available. 

### Continuity 
The page is designed to be user-friendly. The same templates are used on each page with similar headers and footers. This should make it easy and accessible for each user. 

## Technologies used 
### Languages used

### Frameworks, libraries, and programs used:
* [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
    - Used to create mockup of the information page for the README.md.
* [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com) 
    - This framework was used to ensure all pages were responsive across all devices.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) 
    - Using well-known icons to highlight text throughout the site, to enhance the user experience.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
    - Used via the [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) platform to create, commit, and push changes in the code to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) 
    - Project stored in a repository and to incorporate changes made using Git. Also used for deployment via GitHub Pages. 
* [Tinypng](https://www.tinypng.com) 
    - Used to reduce images in size to aid loading on site. 
* [Typekit](https://fonts.adobe.com/)

## Testing 
* All HTML code was validated by [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

> * [Results of index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&showoutline=yes&showimagereport=yes&useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+http%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmichaelmcfarlandcampbell.github.io%2Fportcominfo%2Findex.html)

* All CSS stylings were validated by [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### CSS styling
Although the CSS was validated by the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), during testing, it was noted by one user that the six areas: #banking #church, #food, #fuel, #leisure, and #pharmacy are all defined separately with a class for each with a `padding-top:20px` style. This could be achieved by creating a new class to join them all together and defining in that class. This would reduce the code required. 

Therefore, I created a new class of `info-area {padding-top: 20px;}` to replace `#banking {padding-top:20px;}`, `#church {padding-top:20px;}`, `#food {padding-top:20px;}`, `#fuel {padding-top:20px;}`, `#leisure {padding-top:20px;}`, and  `#pharmacy {padding-top:20px;}`.

### Links "noreferrer" attribute
It was noted that external links should have `rel="noopener"` as an attribute. So for social media links in the footer and the covid/local info for security purposes. Therefore, I added this in. 

### Call to action/hover in main menu
During user testing, it was noted that the hover was not easy to be seen. So, I changed the navbar to `navbar-dark bg-dark`, and having researched how to change the background for the hover in the navbar, I copied the code from [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16625972/change-color-of-bootstrap-navbar-on-hover-link), and removed the `.navbar-default` class and the `color` attribute. The background colour was then changed to match the main colour of the site ![872658](https://via.placeholder.com/15/872658/000000?text=+)&nbsp;`#872658`.

### Images 

Following feedback from my mentor that the images on the site were far too large to download quickly, especially if users were on a mobile connection, I used the [tinypng.com](https://www.tinypng.com) to reduce their sizes. The three clothing pictures on the Support page were reduced in size by about 80%. 

### Additional feature
Realised that users would not know which of the venues were closed due to the COVID-19 Level 5, so I decided to add a badge to show this. 

Created a badge using `<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-warning uppercase">Closed due to COVID-19</span>`.

When testing the site after this change, I realised that the <span style="background-color:#ffc107">Closed due to COVID-19</span> badge was too long and so had pushed the phone number into the right-hand margin when on an iPhone 6. 

<img src="readme/portinfo-2021-testing-covid19badge.png">

Therefore, I altered the code to `<br><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-warning uppercase">Closed<br>COVID-19</span>`. which gave a badge of 

<span style="background-color:#ffc107">Closed<br>COVID-19</span>. This ensured that the phone numbers remained in the box.

### Browsers
**Chrome** 

**Edge** 
All pages loaded well in Edge. I checked all the pages in all the formats available in the devtools. The only one where the information page leaked to the right hand side, was for the Galaxy Fold. I used the Lighthouse tool in the development section which produced the following reports:

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you get to the **Git Hub Pages** section. 
4. Under **Source** click where it says "None" and select "Branch: master".
5. The page will refresh automatically. 
6. Scroll back down to find **GitHub Pages** section, and the link to the site will be displayed.
